# CodeVault
 A python based code snippet manager.

This was my first "real" python project.
It uses PyQt5, and GUI was designed using the QT designer.
It features the ability to add code snippets to categories that the user creates.

To run this you need to install PyQt5 with:
pip install PyQt5

and then simply run with:
python frontend.py.
